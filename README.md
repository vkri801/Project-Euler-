## Problem 1 

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

Class Problem_1 is dedicated to this problem. It was an easy solution as the problem was trivial and so didn't require much processing.
*Can use geometric approach if numbers become greater but simpler is better unless necessary*

If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.
Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

Answer: 233168


## Problem 50

A somewhat complex problem. A sieve of Eratosthenes was used to find primes. Class Problem_50 was dedicated to this problem.

The prime 41, can be written as the sum of six consecutive primes:
41 = 2 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 11 + 13
This is the longest sum of consecutive primes that adds to a prime below one-hundred.
The longest sum of consecutive primes below one-thousand that adds to a prime, contains 21 terms, and is equal to 953.
Which prime, below one-million, can be written as the sum of the most consecutive primes?

Answer: 997651
